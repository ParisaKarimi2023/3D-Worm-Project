# 3D Worm Project
The 3D Worm Project is a computer graphics–based simulation that visualizes the movement and behavior of a worm-like entity in a three-dimensional environment.
The project focuses on modeling articulated motion, spatial transformations, and real-time rendering using Python.
By simulating a worm composed of connected segments, the project demonstrates fundamental concepts in 3D geometry, animation, and algorithmic motion control.
This system can be extended for educational simulations, game development, and biological modeling.
